= Exporting mappings to an AtlasMap catalog file

After all mappings are defined, save the mappings by exporting
them to an AtlasMap `.adm` catalog file:

. In the AtlasMap top tool bar, click 
image:ExportIcon.png[Export]. 
+
This captures your workspace in a `.adm` catalog file. 

. In the *Export mappings* field, accept the default name or enter
a name for the exported `.adm` file. The default name is `atlasmap-mapping.adm`.

. Click *OK*.

AtlasMap places the exported file in the `Downloads` directory. 

[TIP]
To set AtlasMap to the state at which you exported data mappings, 
import a `.adm` catalog file by clicking 
image:Import-Data-Shape.png[Import]
in the AtlasMap top tool bar. Navigate to the `.adm` file 
and click *Open*.

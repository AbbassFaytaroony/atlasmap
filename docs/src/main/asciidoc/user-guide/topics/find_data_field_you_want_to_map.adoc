= Find the data field that you want to map

In a relatively simple integration, mapping data fields is easy
and intuitive. In more complex integrations or in integrations that handle
large sets of data fields, mapping from source to target is easier when
you have some background about how to use the data mapper.

The data mapper displays two columns of data fields:

* *Sources* is a list of the data fields that you can map to target fields.
* *Target* is a list of the data fields that you can map source fields to.

To quickly find the data field that you
want to map, you can do any of the following:

* Search for it.
+
The *Sources* panel and the *Target* panel each have
a search field at the top. If the search field is not visible, click
image:images/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] at the top
right of the *Sources* or *Target* panel.

* Enter the names of the fields that you want to map.
+
To do this,
in the upper right of the *Configure Mapper* page, click the plus sign
to display the *Mapping Details* panel. In the *Sources* section, enter
the name of the source field. In the *Action* section, accept the
default *Map*, which maps one field to one other field. Or, select
*Combine* or *Separate*. In the *Target* section, enter the name of the
field that you want to map to.

* Expand and collapse folders to limit the visible fields.

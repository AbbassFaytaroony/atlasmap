= Export AtlasMap Data Mapper Catalog File

Once all required schema files and JARs have been imported and all mappings
have been defined you can save your work using the *export* button.  The export
button captures all of your workspace into an ADM (`.adm`) catalog file.  This
file may be used with the *import* button to reinitialize AtlasMap to the state
at which the export button was clicked.  The export button can be found on the
main toolbar:

Once it is clicked, an *Export mappings* dialog appears.  A standard default name for the ADM file appears as a
placeholder (`atlasmap-mapping.adm`).  You may override that file name as desired.

Once you click the `OK` button the catalog file will be written with the specified name to the
local `Downloads` directory.

[id='transform-target-data']
= Transform source or target data

In the data mapper, after you define a mapping, you can transform
any field in the mapping.
Transforming a data field defines how you want to store the data.
For example, you could specify the *Capitalize* transformation to ensure that the first
letter of a data value is uppercase.

.Procedure

. Map the fields. This can be a one-to-one mapping, a combination mapping,
or a separation mapping.
. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources* or under *Targets*,
in the box for the field that you want to transform, click the arrow to the left of the
trash can icon.

This displays a pull-down where you can select the transformation
that you want the data mapper to perform.  Note that the set of available transformations is type specific.

. Click in this field to display the list of transformations.
. Click the transformation that you want to perform.
. If the transformation requires any input parameters, specify them
in the appropriate input fields.
. To add another compound transformation, click the arrow to the left of the
trash can icon again.

In addition to the list of fixed transformations, users may define their own custom field
action transformations.  These custom field actions are written in Java and are then imported
into the AtlasMap data mapper.  Once established in a panel the transformation will appear
in the standard list of transformations.  For example:

.Procedure

. Create a transformation.  For example:

This custom transformation is applicable to `String` arguments.  It takes the argument specified in the Source panel
transformation and prints it out on the Target side.  Implement the `AtlasFieldAction` class as follows:
```
package io.atlasmap.service.my;

import io.atlasmap.v2.*;
import io.atlasmap.api.AtlasFieldAction;
import io.atlasmap.spi.AtlasFieldActionInfo;

public class PaulsFieldActions implements AtlasFieldAction {

    @AtlasFieldActionInfo(name = "MyCustomFieldActionPaul", sourceType = FieldType.STRING, targetType = FieldType.STRING,
			  sourceCollectionType = CollectionType.NONE, targetCollectionType = CollectionType.NONE)
    public static String myCustomFieldAction(String input) {
        return "Paul's custom field action: " + input;
    }

}
```
. Build your java archive file.  The `io.atlasmap.v2`, `io.atlasmap.api` and `io.atlasmap.spi` target dependencies are most easily resolved
through the use of a maven `pom.xml` file.  Use the same version number as the AtlasMap standalone JAR that you previously downloaded.

. Import your java archive via the import icon of the AtlasMap main tool bar.

. Navigate to the JAR file containing your custom field action and select it.

. Select the plus icon (+) to enable the class within the field action JAR file.

. A dialog appears "Establish your class in the Sources panel."
In the *Class package name:* input field, enter the class package name of the Java class you have defined for your custom field action.
In the `MyFieldAction.jar` example, the class package name is `io.atlasmap.service.my.PaulsFieldActions`.

. Select the pull-down menu in the *Targets* window within the *Mapping Details* section.  You will notice that your
custom field action now appears as a selectable field action transformation.  Select it.

. Test your custom field action.

Select the image:EditorSettings.png[Panel settings] icon on the AtlasMap main tool bar.  Check the checkbox for `Show Mapping Preview`

image:Trans8.png[Import custom field action JAR]

In the Source panel there will exist and input field.  Type a string into it  (for example `test`).  Now focus
your cursor in the *Preview Results* field in the Target panel.  You will see the same string.

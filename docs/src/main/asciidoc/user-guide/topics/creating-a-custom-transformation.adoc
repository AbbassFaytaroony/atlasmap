= Creating a custom transformation 

In addition to the built-in transformations, you can define custom field
action transformations. Write custom field actions in Java and then import them
into the AtlasMap data mapper. After it is established in a source or target 
panel, the transformation appears
in the list of transformations that are available for any field.  

.Procedure

. Define a transformation in Java.
+
The following custom transformation is applicable to `String` arguments.  
It takes the argument specified in the source panel
transformation and prints it on the target side.  
Implement the `AtlasFieldAction` class as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
package io.atlasmap.service.my;

import io.atlasmap.v2.*;
import io.atlasmap.api.AtlasFieldAction;
import io.atlasmap.spi.AtlasFieldActionInfo;

public class PaulsFieldActions implements AtlasFieldAction {

    @AtlasFieldActionInfo(name = "MyCustomFieldActionPaul", sourceType = FieldType.STRING,
        targetType = FieldType.STRING, sourceCollectionType = CollectionType.NONE,
        targetCollectionType = CollectionType.NONE)
    public static String myCustomFieldAction(String input) {
        return "Paul's custom field action: " + input;
    }

}
----

. Build your Java archive file.
+
The `io.atlasmap.v2`, `io.atlasmap.api` and `io.atlasmap.spi` target 
dependencies are most easily resolved
through the use of a maven `pom.xml` file.  Use the same version number as 
the AtlasMap standalone JAR file that you previously downloaded.

. At the top of the AtlasMap main tool bar, click 
image:Import-Data-Shape.png[Import] to import your Java archive file.

. Navigate to the JAR file that contains your custom transformation 
and select it.

. To enable the class that defines the custom transformation, 
for this example, at the top of the *Target* panel, 
select the plus icon (+).
+

. In the *Class package name:* field, enter the class package name of 
the Java class that defines the custom transformation.
In the `MyFieldAction.jar` example, the class package 
name is `io.atlasmap.service.my.PaulsFieldActions`.

+
. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Targets* section, 
select the transformation pull-down menu to see that your
custom transformation now appears as a selectable 
transformation. Select it.

. To test your custom transformation:
.. In the AtlasMap main tool bar, click
image:EditorSettings.png[Panel settings].
.. Click *Show Mapping Preview*.

.. In the *Source* panel input field,  
type a string, for example, `test`.  
.. Notice the same string in the 
*Preview Results* field in the target panel.

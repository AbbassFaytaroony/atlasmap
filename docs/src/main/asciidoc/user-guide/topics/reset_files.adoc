= Reset the AtlasMap Data Mapper

Upon initial installation of AtlasMap the user is presented with a blank canvas.
No mappings are possible until the user imports files into the Source and Target panels.
Once imported, users may remove imported files using the trash can icon:

If a user wishes to remove *all* imported files as well as all mappings then select the
image:EditorSettings.png[Panel settings] icon on the AtlasMap main tool bar and select `Reset All`
from the pull down menu.

A challenge dialog will appear to verify that the user wants to remove all
files.

Once the `Reset` button is clicked AtlasMap is reset and the user is presented with a fresh blank canvas.

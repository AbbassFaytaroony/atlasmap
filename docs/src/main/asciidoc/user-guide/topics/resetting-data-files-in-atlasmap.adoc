= Resetting data files in AtlasMap 

Initially, AtlasMap displays a blank canvas. You must import at least 
one data file into the *Source* panel and at least one data file into 
the *Target* panel. You can then map fields. 

After you import a data file, you can remove it from the data mapper 
canvas by clicking the trash icon, as in the following image:

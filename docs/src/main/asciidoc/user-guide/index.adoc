[[introduction]]

AtlasMap is a data mapping solution with an interactive web based user interface.
It simplifies configuration of an integration that handles different
types of data, such as  Java, XML, or JSON data. You design your data
mapping in the AtlasMap Data Mapper UI canvas, and then run that data mapping
by means of a runtime engine. We have a camel-atlasmap component which consumes
AtlasMap mapping definition and process data mapping as a part of Camel route.

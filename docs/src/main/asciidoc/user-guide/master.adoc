= Using the AtlasMap Data Mapper UI

AtlasMap is a data mapper with an interactive web based user interface.
It simplifies configuration of an integration that handles different
types of data, such as  Java, XML, or JSON data. You design your data
mapping in the AtlasMap Data Mapper UI canvas, and then run that data mapping
by means of a runtime engine.

Details for mapping data fields are in the following topics:

* <<find-the-field-you-want-to-map>>
* <<map-one-source-field-to-one-target-field>>
* <<example-missing-unwanted-data>>
* <<combine-multiple-source-fields-into-one-target-field>>
* <<separate-one-source-field-into-multiple-target-fields>>
* <<transform-target-data>>
* <<view-mappings>>
* <<available-transformations>>
